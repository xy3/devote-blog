# Voting

My next goal was to implement the voting function into the website with a selector for choosing your candidate. In the video below you can see how the voting component was designed and how it works.

# Dedicated Election Pages & Account Page

We wanted to make an easily accessible way for users to access the election they needed to vote in. The best solution was to develop a new page for each election made. The url of each election is *'/elections/election_id'*. Now the link can be shared to people you want to vote in your election, and they don't have to go searching around the site to find it. The account page was also made to display all elections that your account has made in one table. You can currently create elections from the home page and the accounts page.

## Improved Dedicated Elections 
The dedicated election page now works but only shows the election table. I added the ability to change the election name, add new candidates and delete candidates (only accessible to owner of election).
