# Finishing touches

Once the last features were added to the app, all there was left to do was to refactor and improve the code. We went through the code thoroughly to check for bugs, unused code and areas that could be improved. We also developed some unit tests using the Mocha testing framework and Chai for assertions.

### Other completed changes include:
 - The domain devote.ie was purchased for a more professional looking URL to the website. 
 - SCSS Style updates
 - Technical Specification
 - User Manual
 - Installation video
 - Walkthrough video
 - Code restructuring
