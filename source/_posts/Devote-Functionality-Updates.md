## Launch
We needed a foundation to build our project on. So to start, we made one basic election, with the functionality to allow users to vote once. This is one of the core features of a voting system, and we successfully achieved a working election.

## Redesign

Now that we had some basic functionality working, Theo developed the front end and I got working on having multiple elections instead of just one. We both finished our work and merged it to the github. Below is the result of a new front end and multiple elections.

## Viewing Elections Functionality

In the previous video we had a list of elections on the home page, but you couldn't see the candidates and their votes for that election. The next step was to implement the back-end for the view buttons in the table. By taking full advantage of React's dynamic rendering, we were able to create a second table below that listed the candidates for whatever election was selected in the election list.
