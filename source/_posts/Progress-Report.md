## Current progress

Once we both became familiar with ReactJS, the progress on our project really sped up. Using React, we can easily work on seperate components at the same time. We now have a working voting app albeit still missing some features. 

Below is a screenshot of our Trello board which we are using to track our progress in addition to this blog.

### Focus on societies

Our focus is now on making the app as usable and feature rich as possible for college societies. This includes adding societies, controlling which users can vote in your election, and managing society members.
