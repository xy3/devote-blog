Today we met our project supervisor at 2pm to discuss our current progress on our project. We had not seen our project supervisor (Annalina Caputo) since before Christmas so there was a lot to catch up on. Our project specs have changed slightly due to our research and experience developing so we discussed how they will tie into our final product. 

## Updates

- Decided to use React JS for rendering the front end - Django / Flask is out.
- Improved our plan to work collaboratively
- Finished homepage user interface
- Finished preliminary smart contract for testing
